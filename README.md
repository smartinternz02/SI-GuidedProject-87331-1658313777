Effective Heart Disease Prediction Using IBM Auto AI Service

Heart Disease is even highlighted as a silent killer which leads to the death of the person without obvious symptoms. The early diagnosis of heart disease plays a vital role in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This project aims to predict future Heart Disease by analysing data of patients which classifies whether they have heart disease or not using machine-learning algorithms. The load of cardiovascular disease is rapidly increasing all over the world from the past few years. Many researches have been conducted in attempt to pinpoint the most influential factors of heart disease as well as accurately predict the overall risk. Machine learning proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the health care industry. This project aims to predict future Heart Disease by analyzing data of patients which classifies whether they have heart disease or not using machine-learning algorithm. Heart disease is even being highlighted as a silent killer which leads to the death of a person without obvious symptoms. The nature of the disease is the cause of growing anxiety about the disease & its consequences. Hence continued efforts are being done to predict the possibility of this deadly disease in prior. 

Proposed solution :
The working of the system starts with the collection of data and selecting the 
important attributes. Then the required data is preprocessed into the required format. 
The data is then divided into two parts training and testing data. The algorithms are 
applied and the model is trained using the training data. The accuracy of the system is 
obtained by testing the system using the testing data. This system is implemented 
using the following modules. 
1.) Collection of Dataset 
2.) Selection of attributes 
3.) Data Pre-Processing 
4.) Disease Prediction
Collection of dataset: 
Initially, we collect a dataset for our heart disease prediction system. After the collection of the dataset, we split the dataset into training data and testing data. The training dataset is used for prediction model learning and testing data is used for evaluating the prediction model.
Selection of attributes :
Attribute or Feature selection includes the selection of appropriate attributes for the prediction system. This is used to increase the efficiency of the system. Various attributes of the patient like gender, chest pain type, fasting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, exang, etc are selected for the prediction. The Correlation matrix is used for attribute selection for this model.
Pre-processing of Data :
Data pre-processing is an important step for the creation of a machine learning model. Initially, data may not be clean or in the required format for the model which can cause misleading outcomes. In pre-processing of data, we transform data into our required format.
Prediction of Disease :
Various machine learning algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Tree, Logistic Regression, Ada-boost, XG-boost are used for classification. Comparative analysis is performed among algorithms and the algorithm that gives the highest accuracy is used for heart disease prediction.
